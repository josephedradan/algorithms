Purpose:
    Using hashes to solve the N Queens problem

Details:

Description:

Notes:
    * CHECKS TO SEE IF A B VALUE IS ALREADY USED TO COMPARE DIAGONALS

    For a diagonal checker, don't check for slope to be the same because that requires a loop.

Time Complexity:
    If n == length of row and m == length of column

        ~ Time Complexity:
            O((n*m) * (p) * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1))
        Notes
            1. n*m = traverse grid
            2. p = successful queen placement
            3. 1 = check if hash of column index in set column index
            4. 1 = check if hash of row index in set row index
            5. 1 = check if (x, y)'s bot to top b value in set bot to top b value
            6. 1 = check if (x, y)'s tot to bop b value in set tot to bop b value

            Does not include the solutions lists

Space Complexity:
    If n == length of row and m == length of column

        Space Complexity:
            O(n*m + a + b + c + d)

            Where a, b, c, d are less than n*m

        Notes:
            1. n*m = the grid
            2. a = set column index
            2. b = set row index

    Using two y = mx + b equations to represent the diagonals where a queen can attack from, if we rearrange the 
    equations in terms of b, we can represent an entire diagonal because the b value is a vertical shifter of the

    value that represents the entire diagonal. 
    
    Basically, if we solve for b in b = y - mx, we get a constant value, this constant value will be the same across an
    entire diagonal. This means that if we are given an x and y position and we solve for a b value for either diagonal 
    and that b value is found in its corresponding set (set_b_initial_bot_top or set_b_initial_top_bot), we know that
    we cannot place a queen at x, y because a queen is attacking this diagonal.
